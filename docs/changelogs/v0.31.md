### Overview

### 🔦 Highlights

#### Pebble Plugin

Pebble provides a high-performance alternative to leveldb as the datastore, and will serve as a replacement for badger1.

There are a number of tuning parameters available for tuning pebble's performance to your specific needs. Default values are used for any parameters that are not configured or are set to their zero-value.

For a description of the available tuning parameters, see: https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/datastores.md#pebbleds
